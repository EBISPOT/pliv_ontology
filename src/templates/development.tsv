PLIV:0000011	1-cell stage	zygote period	gamete stage				0	Zygote. Fertilized egg surrounded by the fertilization envelope. Time since fertilization is 0 min.
PLIV:0000012	cleavage period	embryonic development	zygote period					
PLIV:0000013	2-cell stage	cleavage period	1-cell stage				1h 40'	Two-cell stage embryo. The first cleavage plane is meridional and generates two blastomeres of equal size. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 1hr 40min.
PLIV:0000014	4-cell stage	cleavage period	2-cell stage				2hr 30'	Four-cell stage embryo. The second cleavage plane is also meridional and perpendicular to the first one generating four blastomeres of equal size. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 2hr 30min.
PLIV:0000015	8-cell stage	cleavage period	4-cell stage				3h 20'	Eight-cell stage embryo. The third cleavage is perpendicular to the first two cleavage planes, and in general equatorial. It separates the animal from vegetal territories from one another. Each territory is composed of four cells of equal volume. Not infrequently, though, the furrow can be subequatorial, so that the 4 animal blastomeres are larger than the vegetal quartet. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 3hr 20min.
PLIV:0000016	16-cell stage	cleavage period	8-cell stage				4h 10'	Sixteen-cell stage embryo. All animal and vegetal cells have undergone a fourth cleavage. In the animal hemisphere, this cleavage divided the cells meridionally into eight blastomeres (the mesomeres) of equal volumes. In the vegetal hemisphere, the cells divided unequally through an equatorial cleavage producing four large cells below the equator (the macromeres) and four small cells (the micromeres) at the vegetal pole. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 4hr 10 min.
PLIV:0000017	28-cell stage	cleavage period	16-cell stage				4h 45'	Twenty eight-cell stage embryo. The eight mesomeres divided equatorially and equally to produce the animal tiers an1 at the animal pole and the animal tier an2 located below an1. The macromeres divided meridionally, forming a ring of eight equal cells located below an2. The micromeres have not yet divided. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 4hr 45min.
PLIV:0000018	32-cell stage	cleavage period	28-cell stage				5h	Thirty two-cell stage embryo. This stage is relatively fleeting. A few minutes before the other cells undergo the 6th cleavage, the micromeres divided again unequally and equatorially to produce four large micromeres and four small micromeres at the vegetal pole. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 5hr.
PLIV:0000019	56-cell stage	cleavage period	32-cell stage				5h 30'	Fifty sixth-cell stage embryo. During the sixth cleavage, most blastomeres concomitantly undergo an equatorial cleavage, except for the large and small micromeres of which division is somewhat delayed. The embryo is hence composed at that time of 56-cells, including from the animal to the vegetal pole: 16 an1-cells, 16 an2-cells, 8 veg1-cells, 8 veg2-cells, 8 large micromeres and 4 small micromeres. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 5hr 30min.
PLIV:0000020	60-cell stage	cleavage period	56-cell stage				5h 50'	Sixty cell-stage embryo. At the end of 6th cleavage, the large micromereshave achieved an equatorial divisiongenerating a 60 cell-stageembryo. Time since fertilization is5hr 50min.

PLIV:0000022	very early blastula stage	blastula period	60-cell stage		vEB		6h 50'	Very early blastula stage embryo. At the end of seventh cleavage, the embryo is formed of about 108 cells, including 8 large and 4 small micromeres presenting a rate of division slower than that of the other cells composing the embryo. The cells start to acquire an apico-basal polarity and form a hollow sphere surrounding a central cavity called the blastocoel. Every cell is in contact with the fluid of the blastocoel on the inside and the hyaline layer on the outside. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 6hr 50min.
PLIV:0000023	early blastula stage	blastula period	very early blastula stage		EB		7h 50'	Early blastula stage embryo. The cells continue to divide but the synchrony of cell division ends. At the end of 8th cleavage, the embryo is composed of about 220 cells. Cell divisions proceed by waves from the vegetal to the animal pole. There are 16 large micromeres at the end of 8th cleavage. The embryo remains spherical and one cell layer thick. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 7hr 50min.
PLIV:0000024	mid-blastula stage	blastula period	early blastula stage		mid-B		8h 50'	Mid-blastula stage embryo. Additional cell divisions took place increasing the overall number of cells composing the embryo but without affecting its general size or spherical shape. At that stage, cell divisions are so asynchronous that it is no longer possible to refer to a general 8th, 9th or 10th cleavage. The embryo encompasses between 16 and 32 large micromeres and 8 small micromeres in the vegetal pole region. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 8hr 50min.
PLIV:0000025	prehatching blastula stage	blastula period	mid-blastula stage		pre-HB		10h 20'	Prehatching blastula stage embryo. The blastula starts becoming motile inside the fertilization envelop. Cilia have developed on the outer surfaces of the cells all around the embryo. The diameter of the blastocoel is about half the size of the embryo. Cells secrete a basal lamina. There are about 32 large micromeres and 8 small micromeres in the vegetal pole region. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 10hr 20min.
PLIV:0000026	hatching blastula stage	blastula period	prehatching blastula stage		HB		11h	Hatching blastula stage embryo. The ciliated blastula begins to rotate within the fertilization envelope. The cells from the ectoderm start synthesizing and secreting the hatching enzyme, a metalloprotease that will digest the fertilization envelope and free the embryo. The embryo is composed of about 350 cells. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 11hr.
PLIV:0000027	swimming blastula stage	blastula period	hatching blastula stage		SB		12 h	Swimming blastula stage embryo. The embryo is spherical and has hatched from the fertilization envelope. It swims. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 12hr.
PLIV:0000028	late swimming blastula stage	blastula period	swimming blastula stage		late-SB		13 hr	Late swimming blastula stage embryo. The vegetal region of the embryo is thickened and flattened. At the animal pole domain a tuft of long and immotile cilia can be observed, it features the site of the apical pole domain (or apical neuroectodermal domain). The embryo is composed of about 500 cells. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 13hr.
PLIV:0000029	gastrula period	embryonic development	blastula period					
PLIV:0000030	early mesenchyme blastula stage	gastrula period	late swimming blastula stage		eMB		14 hr	Early mesenchyme blastula stage embryo. The progeny of the large micromeres (about 32 cells) present at the center of the vegetal plate, extend, contract and project filopodia within the blastocoel. These cells progressively loose their apico-basal polarity, round up, dissociate from the epithelial monolayer and ingress into the blastocoel. Once in the blastocoel, these cells are called the skeletogenic mesoderm (or primary mesenchyme cells). At the animal pole the animal neuroectoderm region bearing the long cilia becomes thicker. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 14hr.
PLIV:0000031	mesenchyme blastula stage	gastrula period	early mesenchyme blastula stage		MB		15h	Mesenchyme blastula stage embryo. All skeletogenic mesoderm (SM) cells have ingressed in the blastocoel leaving behind the vegetal plate reformed composed of the small micromeres and the non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells. Within the blastocoel the SM cells spread over the vegetal plate and migrate through active extension and retraction of filopodia, exploring and sensing the blastocoel wall looking for selective patterning cues. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 15hr.
PLIV:0000032	blastopore gastrula stage	gastrula period	mesenchyme blastula stage		blasto-G		18h	Blastopore gastrula stage embryo. The cells that remained within the vegetal plate bound again to one another, and undergo important cell shape changes leading to the bending inward of the vegetal plate and the initiation of the invagination of the archenteron, which in sea urchin is hence launched by the non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells (about 30 cells). The opening with a blind end created at the vegetal pole of the embryo is the blastopore, which will give rise to the future anus. At this stage, the first morphological signs of the second embryonic axis emerge, the oral-aboral axis or the dorso-ventral axis. This apparent bilateral symmetry is observable due to a subpopulation of SM cells that gather in two ventrolateral aggregates forming the SM aggregation clusters, while the remaining SM cells form two chains (the ventral chain and the dorsal chain) connecting the clusters and surrounding the developing archenteron. Time since fertilization at 18°C is around 18hr.
PLIV:0000033	early gastrula stage	gastrula period	blastopore gastrula stage		eG		20h	Early gastrula stage embryo. The primary invaginated archenteron (about 40 cells) slightly extends within the blastocoel by invagination of additional non-skeletogenic mesoderm and endoderm cells. The SM cells localized within the prospective ventrolateral region of the blastocoel started fusing into syncytial cables, beginning at the level of the ventrolateral clusters. From the SM clusters, some SM cells further start migrating towards the animal pole. They will form the lateral arms of the SM cells syncitium. At this stage, one side of the gastrula flattens and becomes thicker than the rest of the larva. This flattened side is the presumptive ventral side where the mouth will ultimately open. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 20hr
PLIV:0000034	mid gastrula stage	gastrula period	early gastrula stage		mid-G		22h	Mid gastrula stage embryo. After a brief pause, a new phase of archenteron formation begins during which the archenteron extends dramatically, going from 3-4 to 10 cell tiers and sometimes tripling its initial length. The cellular process by which this elongation takes place (i.e. convergent extension or cell division) remains to be elucidated for P. lividus. At that stage, the SM cells syncitium start calcifying at the level of the ventrolateral clusters to form the primary triradiate skeletal rudiments. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 22hr
PLIV:0000035	late gastrula stage	gastrula period	mid gastrula stage		late-G		24h	Late gastrula stage embryo. The last stage of archenteron elongation is taking place by tension provided by the non-skeletogenic mesenchyme cells present at the tip of the archenteron. The tip of the archenteron attach to the animal pole region through the production of filopodia by some non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells. These filopodia are extended in the direction of the oral ectoderm, attached the wall and then shortened pulling up the archenteron. In parallel, other non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells ingress from the tip of the archenteron. The skeletal rods grow on each side of the basis of the archenteron and along the lateral ectoderm. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 24hr
PLIV:0000036	prism period	embryonic development	gastrula period					
PLIV:0000037	prism stage	prism period	late gastrula stage		Pr		32h	Prism stage embryo. The embryo takes an overall triangular shape due to the elongation of the skeletal rods and to morphogenesis of the ectoderm along the dorsal-ventral axis. A small depression appears at the center of the ventral ectoderm. This is the presumptive oral field that invaginates due to an autonomous pulsatory activity of the ectoderm cells. It will give rise to the stomodeum. Pigment cells, which represent part of the immune system of the larvae, start getting pigmented and inserted within the aboral ectoderm while other populations of immunocytes such as blastocoelar cells remain in the blastocoel around the gut. At the interface between the ventral and dorsal ectodermal regions, forms the neurogenic territory of the ciliary band, composed of 6 to 8 rows of cuboidal ciliated cells. In contrast, ectodermal cells on the dorsal side become flattened and squamous. The blind end of the archenteron has reached the stomodeal invagination and they will soon fuse to create the mouth. The digestive tract is further starting to become tripartite, segregating from the mouth to the anus: the esophagus, the stomach and the intestine. Within the animal neuroectoderm and the ciliary band differentiating neuronal cells are starting to emerge. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 32hr.

PLIV:0000039	pluteus larvae period	larval development	prism period					
PLIV:0000040	early pluteus stage	pluteus larvae period	prism stage		Plut		40h	Early pluteus stage larva. The mouth has formed and the digestive tract tripartition is now completed with the formation of the cardiac sphincter in between the esophagus and the stomach, the pyloric sphincter in between the stomach and the intestine and the anal sphincter at the level of the anus. In the vicinity of the mouth and the oesophagus, the non skeletogenic mesodermal cells have arranged to form a single unpaired coelomic rudiment. The larvae now possess as well a network of contractile muscles surrounding chiefly the esophagus and allowing swallowing and feeding. The nervous network of the larvae continues to form and extend. The larvae is starting extending four arms, i.e. two antero-lateral arms and two post-oral arms. Time since fertilization is at 18°C about 40hr.
PLIV:0000041	pluteus 4-arms stage	pluteus larvae period	early pluteus stage		Plut4a		48h	Pluteus 4-arms stage larvae. The pluteus larvae have extended their antero-lateral and post-oral arms and sleeked their apex. The coelomic rudiment has started to form bilobed sacs on each side of the oesophagus separated by an isthmus. The first signs of left-righ asymmetry become apparent: the size of the left coelomic pouch is slightly larger than the right one. A thin protrusion of mesenchymal cells can be seen extending from the left coelomic pouch to the dorsal ectoderm. This is the primary pore canal. Time since fertilization at 18°C is 48hr.
PLIV:0000042	pluteus 6-arms stage	pluteus larvae period	pluteus 4-arms stage		Plut6a		 +/- 14d	Pluteus 6-arms stage larvae. The pluteus larvae have extended two postero-dorsal arms and their nervous systems have become more complex. The left coelom has been partitioned into three parts: the upper part remains close to the oesophagus, the middle part becomes the hydrocoel and the third one, close to the stomach, becomes the somatocoel. At the basis of the posterodorsal arm on the left side, a small portion of the ectoderm, the vestibule, thickens and invaginates, comes into contact and associates with the left hydocoel to form the adult rudiment, from which most of the adult tissues will emerge. Time since fertilization at 18°C is about 2 weeks.
PLIV:0000043	pluteus 8-arms stage	pluteus larvae period	pluteus 6-arms stage		Plut8a		 +/- 18d	Pluteus 8-arms stage larvae. The pluteus have extended twoadditional,pre-oral arms around the mouth. The larva has developed four additional rings of motile cilia around the apex called epaulettes. The left coelomic pouch has undergone substantial changes leading to the formation of a disc displaying a pentaradial symmetry and corresponding to the rudiment of the emerging juvenile. Meanwhile, the right coelomic pouch has led to the formation of a group of precursors of the pedicellaria. Another group of precursors is present near the apex. Time since fertilization at 18°C is about 2 and a half weeks.

PLIV:0000045	pre-metamorphosis larvae stage	pre-metamorphosis larvae period	pluteus 8-arms stage		Pre-meta		 +/- 21d	Pluteus larvae pre-metamorphosis stage. The larvae remains with eight arms. Within the larvae, the rudiment has grown and exhibits spines and tube feet. Time since fertilization at 18°C is about 3 weeks.
PLIV:0000046	metamorphosis		larval development	obo:UBERON_0000105			 +/- 28d	Metamorphosis. The larvae undergo a conspicuous and relatively abrupt change in form and structure to give rise in the end of an hatched juvenile. 
PLIV:0000047	juvenile		metamorphosis	obo:UBERON_0000105			 +/- 32d	Juvenile stage. The little metamorphosed juvenile, of about 1mm in diameter,is crawling on the sea bottom. It possesses 5 primary tube feet and a couple of spines. Time since fertilization at 18°C is about 3 and a half weeks.
PLIV:0000048	adult		juvenile	obo:UBERON_0000105			?	Adult stage. The young adult has grown up to about several centimeters in diameter and is now producing gametes. Time after fertilization is unknown (between several months to one year depending on the rate and type of feeding).
